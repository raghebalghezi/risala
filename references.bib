We performed extensive empirical evaluation using our large email collections and tested with three text classification algorithms, namely, a naive Bayes classifier and two k-NN classifiers using TF–IDF weighting and resemblance respectively. The investigation includes studies on the effect of phrase size, the size of local and global sampling, the neighbourhood size, and various methods to improve the classification accuracy. We determined suitable settings for various parameters of the classifiers and performed a comparison among the classifiers with their best settings. Our result shows that no classifier dominates the others in terms of classification accuracy. Also, we made a number of observations on the special characteristics of emails. In particular, we observed that public emails are easier to classify than private ones.},

The empirical results show that kNN performs the best, followed by our adapted HASRD and the centroid-based classifier for common document categories, while the centroid-based classifier and kNN outperform our adapted HASRD for rare document categories. Additionally, our study clearly indicates that each classifier performs optimally only when a suitable term weighting scheme is used All these significant results lead to many exciting directions for future exploration.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, which incorporates the relationships of concept-based thesauri into the document categorization using the k-NN classifier (k-NN). k-NN is one of the most popular document categorization methods because it shows relatively good performance in spite of its simplicity. However, it significantly degrades precision when ambiguity arises, i.e., when there exist more than one candidate category to which a document can be assigned. To remedy the drawback, we employ concept-based thesauri in the categorization. Employing the thesaurus entails structuring categories into hierarchies, since their structure needs to be conformed to that of the thesaurus for capturing relationships between categories. By referencing various relationships in the thesaurus corresponding to the structured categories, k-NN can be prominently improved, removing the ambiguity. In this paper, we first perform the document categorization by using k-NN and then employ the relationships to reduce the ambiguity. Experimental results show that this method improves the precision of k-NN up to 13.86\% without compromising its recall.},

This paper presents a hybrid method of rule-based processing and back-propagation neural networks for spam filtering. Instead of using keywords, this study utilize the spamming behaviors as features for describing emails. A rule-based process is first employed to identify and digitize the spamming behaviors observed from the headers and syslogs of emails. An enhanced BPNN with a weighted learning strategy is designed as the classification mechanism. Since spamming behaviors are infrequently changed, compared with that of keywords used in spams, the proposed method is more robust with respect to the change of time. The experimental results show that the proposed method is useful in identifying spam emails.},

In this project, the Bayes formula was used to vectorize (as opposed to classify) a document according to a probability distribution reflecting the probable categories that the document may belong to. The Bayes formula gives a range of probabilities to which the document can be assigned according to a predetermined set of topics (categories) such as those found in the "20 Newsgroups" data set for instance. Using this probability distribution as the vectors to represent the document, the SVM can then be used to classify the documents on a multidimensional level. The effects of an inadvertent dimensionality reduction caused by classifying using only the highest probability using the naive Bayes classifier can be overcome using the SVM by employing all the probability values associated with every category for each document. This method can be used for any data set and shows a significant reduction in training time as compared to the Lsquare method and significant improvement in the classification accuracy when compared to pure naive Bayes systems and also the TF-IDF/SVM hybrids.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of computational and statistical approaches have been used for text classification, including nearest-neighbor classification, naïve Bayes classification, support vector machines, decision tree induction, rule induction, and artificial neural networks. Among these approaches, naïve Bayes classifiers have been widely used because of its simplicity. Due to the simplicity of the Bayes formula, the naïve Bayes classification algorithm requires a relatively small number of training data and shorter time in both the training and classification stages as compared to other classifiers. However, a major short coming of this technique is the fact that the classifier will pick the highest probability category as the one to which the document is annotated too. Doing this is tantamount to classifying using only one dimension of a multi-dimensional data set. The main aim of this work is to utilize the strengths of the self organizing map (SOM) to overcome the inadvertent dimensionality reduction resulting from using only the Bayes formula to classify. Combining the hybrid system with new ranking techniques further improves the performance of the proposed document classification approach. This work describes the implementation of an enhanced hybrid classification approach which affords a better classification accuracy through the utilization of two familiar algorithms, the naïve Bayes classification algorithm which is used to vectorize the document using a probability distribution and the self organizing map (SOM) clustering algorithm which is used as the multi-dimensional unsupervised classifier.},

Some use a multi-variate Bernoulli model, that is, a Bayesian Network with no dependencies between words and binary word features (e.g. Larkey and Croft 1996; Koller and Sahami 1997). Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the diﬀerences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classiﬁcation performance on ﬁve text corpora. We ﬁnd that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes—providing on average a 27\% reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size.},
